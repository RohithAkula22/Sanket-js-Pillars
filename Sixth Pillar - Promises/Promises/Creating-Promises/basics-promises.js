// ? How to create a promise?
// ? How can we consume a promise?

// * Promises can be fulfilled and also be breaked

// TODO: Create a Promise

// * In the official ECMAScript docs you will find Promise Objects
// * As Promise Object is Native to JS it is syncronous process.
// * Just creation of the Promise (holder) is immediately done

// TODO - DEF : A Promise is a object that is used as a placeholder for the eventual results of a deferred (and possibly asynchronous) computation

// Any Promise can be in three states : Pending, fulfilled, rejected

/* 

* When we create a new promise object "Pending" is the default state, it represents work in progress.

* If the operation is completed successfully the state goes into "fulfilled" state

* If the operation is failed the state goes into "rejected" state
