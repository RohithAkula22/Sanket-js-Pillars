// * Technically their is no discussion about console.log in ECMAScript documentation
// * console.log is not a core js feature, it is a runtime feature
// * JS doesn't know about console

// * Whether console.log is synchronous or asynchronous totally depends up on how the run time handles it

// TODO: Lets see how node actually handles console.log

// * Technically node calls process.stdout.fd when we use console.log internally

// * Standard streams(We also have them in C, C++, JAVA) - Interconnected way where you can give input or output to your programs using console or files
