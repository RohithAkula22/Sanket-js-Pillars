//  Types of programming languages
// * Imperative
// * Declarative
// * C, C++, Java, JS to some extent - corresponding steps are implemented as written (Imperative)
// * SQL - You just tell logic you don't tell how to get them from, all of this sorted by SQL

// * arr = [1,2,3], you will tell arr[2], go to 2nd index and get me the elemebnt
// * Here we actually. dedicatedly define the collection and mention the steps to get the data from the collection, we can also make it a Declarative kind off thing where we will not mention the collection or steps

// * We will make it kind off Pseudo Declarative, this also exist in Python as well
